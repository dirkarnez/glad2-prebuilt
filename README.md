glad2-prebuilt
==============
Prebuilt of [Dav1dde/glad: Multi-Language Vulkan/GL/GLES/EGL/GLX/WGL Loader-Generator based on the official specs](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad).

Build/config glad2 without the official web ui.

### Notes
- [x] Automated build must be set up for getting rid of the header generation process (which requires a bunch of tools like python)
